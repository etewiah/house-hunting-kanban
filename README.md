# house-hunting-kanban

A tool to help when searching for a house to rent or to buy

Over the course of several months I worked on an idea to help people hunt for properties to buy or rent. For various reasons I realised I wasn't going to be able to complete it to the level needed to monetise it so I've decided to open source it.

If anyone wants to develop this further I will be happy to help but for now my focus is on this project:

[https://singlepropertypages.com/](https://singlepropertypages.com/)

Who knows, I might open source that too at some point (I previously open sourced PropertyWebBuilder which does what you'd expect) - but fingers crossed I think I'll manage to monetize this one ;)

## March 2022 update

An enhanced version of this project is now available here:
